# Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering

## Overview
This repository highlights the strategy of prioritizing exploitation over reverse engineering in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and cybersecurity tasks. The focus is on practical exploitation techniques that help identify and exploit vulnerabilities efficiently without deep code analysis.

## Tools Used
- GDB for debugging and testing exploits
- Ghidra/IDA for binary analysis
- Python for payload creation

## Inspiration
This approach is inspired by the article: [Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering](https://aashutoshlodhi.medium.com/focus-on-exploitation-not-reverse-engineering-d672b637da08).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Follow the examples to learn exploitation techniques
3. Try out the provided challenges
