# ⚡️ Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering 🕵️‍♂️

Welcome to the world of **exploit-first** hacking! Here, we skip tedious reverse engineering and dive straight into finding vulnerabilities and **pwning** binaries like a pro. 

## 🚀 Overview
This repo is all about leveraging **exploitation** techniques over reverse engineering. In real-world attacks and CTFs, time is of the essence ⏳, so we focus on what's important: **breaking things** quickly and efficiently!

## 🛠 Tools of the Trade
- 🐍 **Python**: Generate payloads effortlessly.
- 🐛 **GDB**: Debug, exploit, and learn from the inner workings.
- 🔎 **Ghidra/IDA**: Peek inside binaries when necessary.

## 🔥 Why Exploitation?
Inspired by the awesome article [Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering](https://aashutoshlodhi.medium.com/focus-on-exploitation-not-reverse-engineering-d672b637da08), we dive into **real-world hacking strategies** that prioritize **action** over analysis.

## 💡 How to Get Started
1. **Clone** the repo to your machine.
2. Check out the examples and exploit scripts.
3. **Play** around with the provided challenges to refine your exploitation skills.

## 🚧 Roadmap
- More CTF challenges 🧩
- Exploitation tutorials 🔥
- Advanced payload crafting 🛠
