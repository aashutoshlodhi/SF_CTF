# ⚡️ Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering

## 🔍 Overview
This repository demonstrates the power of **exploitation** techniques over reverse engineering in CTFs and security challenges. Instead of analyzing the code line by line, we focus on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities efficiently.

## 🛠️ Tools
- 🐍 **Python** for payload creation
- 🐛 **GDB** for debugging and exploiting
- 🛡️ **Ghidra/IDA** for binary analysis

## 🧠 Inspiration
Inspired by the article: [Focus on Exploitation, Not Reverse Engineering](https://aashutoshlodhi.medium.com/focus-on-exploitation-not-reverse-engineering-d672b637da08).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repo
2. Follow the examples to learn and apply exploitation techniques
3. Test the provided challenges
