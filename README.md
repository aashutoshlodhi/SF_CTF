# Salesforce CTF Write-Up

In this Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge, I delved into a complex scenario centered around the Salesforce hiring process. This CTF was meticulously crafted to evaluate and enhance participants' expertise across a wide range of cybersecurity and digital forensics disciplines. The challenge presented a multifaceted environment requiring a diverse skill set, including:

- **Network Forensics:** Investigating and analyzing network traffic to uncover hidden information and trace unauthorized activities.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring that actions and findings adhere to relevant regulatory and organizational standards, highlighting the importance of following established protocols.
- **Browser History Forensics:** Scrutinizing web browser history to extract significant data and track user activity.
- **Regular Expressions (Regex):** Employing regex techniques for precise pattern matching and efficient data extraction from various sources.
- **Email Forensics:** Dissecting email communications, including headers and content, to gather evidence and identify potential leads.
- **Memory Forensics:** Analyzing memory dumps to retrieve valuable information and identify potential threats or anomalies.
- **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** Utilizing publicly available information to gather intelligence and piece together critical details.
- **Steganography:** Detecting and decoding hidden data within files or images, revealing concealed messages or information.
- **Linux Log Analysis:** Interpreting logs from Linux systems to identify patterns, anomalies, and potential security breaches.
- **Binary Analysis:** Breaking down and examining binary files to find vulnerabilities or extract hidden information.
- **Log Analysis:** Reviewing and analyzing logs from various systems to detect anomalies, track events, and uncover evidence.
- **Cryptography:** Applying cryptographic techniques to secure communications and solve encryption-related challenges.
- **Windows Log Analysis:** Analyzing logs from Windows systems to investigate activities, detect issues, and gather evidence.
- **Miscellaneous:** Tackling additional tasks and challenges that may not fit neatly into the above categories but are integral to the overall CTF experience.
- **Binary Exploitation:** Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in binary executables to test security and uncover potential exploits.
